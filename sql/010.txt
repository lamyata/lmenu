SQL Server: Difference between PARTITION BY and GROUP BY

ROW_NUMBER() window function

ROW_NUMBER() OVER may be used for a simple table on the returned rows, e.g. to return no more than ten rows:

SELECT * FROM
( SELECT
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY sort_key ASC) AS row_number,
columns
FROM tablename
) AS foo
WHERE row_number <= 11

ROW_NUMBER can be non-deterministic: if sort_key is not unique, each time you run the query it is possible to get different row numbers assigned to any rows where sort_key is the same. When sort_key is unique, each row will always get a unique row number.
RANK() window function

The RANK() OVER window function acts like ROW_NUMBER, but may return more than n rows in case of tie conditions, e.g. to return the top-10 youngest persons:

SELECT * FROM (
SELECT
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY age ASC) AS ranking,
person_id,
person_name,
age
FROM person
)AS foo
WHERE ranking <= 10

The above code could return more than ten rows, e.g. if there are two people of the same age, it could return eleven rows.

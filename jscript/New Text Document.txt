In general, it’s better to use HTTP Headers, because they work always no matter what’s the content type of the response (HTML/JSON/SOAP/string/binary etc.)
The caching HTTP headers can be controlled via attributes on the controller/action methods.

Hi all,

I recently found a jQuery code snippets library available for Visual Studio 2012 and 2013.
For those of you that are not familiar with the term "code snippet": This is a piece of code (shortcut mostly), that helps to write faster the everyday used functions.
For example, we want to iterate through a for loop. Instead of writing for(int i = 0; i < someLength; i++) {}, we just write for, press Tab twice and the loop appears and we can customize it really faster afterwards (using the Tab key to go through the editable properties).

The library can be downloaded from the following link:
http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/577b9c03-71fb-417b-bcbb-94b6d3d326b8

All of the snippets can be viewed from Edit --> IntelliSense --> Insert Snippet 
or simply via the shortcut Ctrl+K, Ctrl +X. 

There are lots of snippets included in this library, but I have removed most of them (the ones that I don't use often), and I've also edited some of them: for example - instead of $(selector).click(func),
I've edited it to be $(selector).on('click', func), which is the appropriate way of handling events from jQuery 1.7.1.

Editing all of the snippets can be achieved really simply, just by following these easy steps:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/k5941d54(v=vs.100).aspx

P.S. There are some snippets embedded in Visual Studio, that are for pure JavaScript(for, switch, cl, etc...). They can be viewed and edited the same way.
I hope that someone will find the snippets as useful as I have.

Happy coding! :)

Hi all,

I've recently found this superb JavaScript style guide a.k.a. how to write good /quality/ JavaScript.
I've no doubt that most of us already knew some of those practices, but I'm also sure that you will find some interesting techniques that you didn't knew or didn't realize until now.

Greetings,
